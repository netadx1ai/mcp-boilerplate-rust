## Quality Gates & Verification Standards

### Pre-Commit Verification Pipeline
```bash
# Code quality
cargo fmt --all
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --tests

# Unit tests
cargo test --workspace --lib --bins

# Integration tests  
cargo test --workspace --tests

# E2E tests
./scripts/run_e2e_tests.sh

# Performance validation
cargo test --release --tests -- --ignored performance_tests
```

### Success Metrics
- **Test Speed**: Complete E2E suite < 30 seconds total
- **Reliability**: 0 flaky tests, 100% consistent results
- **Coverage**: All example servers and both transports tested
- **Isolation**: Tests don't interfere with each other
- **Cleanup**: No leftover processes or temporary files

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- ❌ Long hardcoded sleeps (> 100ms without justification)
- ❌ Tests that depend on external services
- ❌ Flaky tests that sometimes pass/fail
- ❌ Tests that leave running processes
- ❌ Hardcoded ports or file paths

### Best Practices to Follow
- ✅ Use `tokio::time::timeout()` for all async operations
- ✅ Proper resource cleanup in test setup/teardown
- ✅ Isolated test environments (temp dirs, random ports)
- ✅ Clear test names describing what is being validated
- ✅ Comprehensive error scenario testing

---

## Dependencies & Environment Requirements

### Additional Test Dependencies
```toml
[dev-dependencies]
tempfile = "3.0"      # Temporary directories for filesystem tests
reqwest = "0.11"      # HTTP client for REST API testing
assert_cmd = "2.0"    # Command-line testing utilities
predicates = "3.0"    # Assertions for command outputs
serial_test = "3.0"   # Serialize tests that can't run in parallel
```

### Environment Setup
- Rust toolchain with stable version
- Network access for HTTP transport tests
- File system permissions for temporary directory creation
- Available ports for HTTP server testing
- Process spawning capabilities for STDIO transport tests

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Hanging Test Prevention
```rust
// Standard pattern for all E2E tests
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_server_functionality() {
    let result = tokio::time::timeout(
        Duration::from_secs(5),
        actual_test_logic()
    ).await.expect("Test should not hang");
    
    assert!(result.is_ok());
}
```

### Resource Cleanup Pattern
```rust
// Ensure cleanup even on test failure
struct TestCleanup {
    server_handle: Option<tokio::task::JoinHandle<()>>,
    temp_dir: TempDir,
}

impl Drop for TestCleanup {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        // Cleanup logic here
    }
}
```
