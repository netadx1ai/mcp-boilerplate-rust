The Dragon Who Forgot How to Fly
A Fantasy Short Story

In the misty peaks of Mount Ethereal, where clouds kissed ancient stone, lived Zephyr, a dragon who had forgotten the most fundamental truth of his existence—how to fly.

It wasn't always this way. Once, Zephyr soared through starlit skies with wings that caught moonbeams and danced with the wind. But after a terrible storm that claimed his beloved companion, grief had grounded him for so long that his wings grew heavy with doubt, and his heart forgot the lightness needed for flight.

The village below spoke in whispers of the earthbound dragon who tended a garden of rare flowers—a sight so peculiar that traveling merchants would detour just to glimpse the mighty beast gently watering delicate petals with tears that sparkled like diamonds.

One morning, a small girl named Luna wandered up the mountain path, her curiosity stronger than her fear. She found Zephyr carefully transplanting a struggling moonflower, his massive claws more delicate than any gardener's touch.

"Why don't you fly?" Luna asked with the innocent directness of childhood.

Zephyr paused, a single tear falling onto the flower's silver petals. "I have forgotten how," he whispered, his voice like distant thunder.

Luna studied him with wise eyes. "Maybe," she said softly, "you haven't forgotten how to fly. Maybe you've forgotten why."

That night, as Luna slept safely in the village below, Zephyr climbed to the highest peak. He spread his wings—not to remember the mechanics of flight, but to remember the joy, the freedom, the love that had once lifted him skyward.

As the first rays of dawn painted the sky gold, Zephyr launched himself into the air. His wings remembered not through his mind, but through his heart. He soared higher than ever before, carrying with him a moonflower for Luna—a gift from the dragon who remembered why he was meant to touch the sky.

Below, the village awoke to the sight of their guardian dragon dancing with the dawn, and they smiled, knowing that some magic is never truly lost—only temporarily forgotten.
