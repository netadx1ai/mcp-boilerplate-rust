Character Profile: Elena Rodriguez

=== BASIC INFORMATION ===
Name: Elena Rodriguez
Age: 32
Occupation: Cybersecurity Expert & Resistance Fighter
Character Type: Hero

=== PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION ===
Elena stands at 5'6" with an athletic build honed by years of martial arts training. Her dark hair is usually pulled back in a practical ponytail, and her piercing brown eyes seem to constantly analyze her surroundings for potential threats. A small scar above her left eyebrow serves as a reminder of her first encounter with corporate surveillance drones.

She favors practical clothing—dark jeans, comfortable boots, and a leather jacket equipped with hidden pockets for various tech gadgets. Her hands, often stained with circuitry ink, move with the precise confidence of someone equally comfortable with a keyboard or a katana.

=== PERSONALITY TRAITS ===
Strengths:
- Brilliant analytical mind capable of seeing patterns others miss
- Unwavering moral compass that drives her to protect the innocent
- Natural leadership abilities that inspire trust in her team
- Exceptional problem-solving skills under extreme pressure

Weaknesses:
- Tendency to shoulder responsibility for others' failures
- Struggles to trust new people due to past betrayals
- Sometimes becomes so focused on the mission that she neglects self-care
- Has difficulty expressing vulnerability or asking for help

- Always carries a vintage compass given to her by her grandmother
- Hums old Spanish lullabies when concentrating on complex code
- Has an extensive collection of antique encryption devices

=== BACKGROUND STORY ===
Born in Barcelona to a family of teachers, Elena discovered her gift for technology early. She earned her master's degree in Cybersecurity at 24 and quickly rose through the ranks at a prestigious tech firm. However, when she uncovered evidence that her company was selling user data to authoritarian governments, she made the difficult choice to expose them—a decision that cost her everything.

Now wanted by corporate security forces, Elena leads a underground network of hackers and freedom fighters working to preserve digital privacy and human rights in an increasingly surveilled world.

=== MOTIVATIONS ===
Primary Goal: Dismantle the surveillance state and return digital freedom to the people

=== CHARACTER ARC POTENTIAL ===
Elena's journey involves learning to trust others and accept that she cannot save everyone alone. Her character arc centers on transforming from a lone wolf hacker into a true leader who builds lasting alliances and creates systems that can survive without her.

=== DIALOGUE STYLE ===
Elena speaks with quiet intensity, often using technical metaphors. She's multilingual and sometimes slips into Spanish when emotional. Her favorite phrases include "Every system has a backdoor" and "La verdad siempre encuentra una manera" (Truth always finds a way).
